# *Overview*

**I recently completed a Machine Learning course focused on foundational concepts in regression analysis and data exploration. The course provided a deep understanding of linear regression, exploratory data analysis, and key statistical metrics such as R² and VIF (Variance Inflation Factor).**


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## R² (Coefficient of Determination):

    Theory behind the R² metric, learning how to interpret a model's predictions and its ability to explain variance in the dependent variable.

## VIF (Variance Inflation Factor):

    Concept of multicollinearity and its impact on regression models.
